                    Cyberpunk as a genre emerged in the 1980s with works like William Gibson's Neuromancer and
                    Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. It's defined by futuristic dystopias where technology has
                    advanced beyond society's ability to control it, leading to corporate dominance, urban decay,
                    and the rise of anti-establishment rebels. The aesthetic of cyberpunk includes neon-lit cityscapes,
                    cybernetic enhancements, and a fusion of high-tech with gritty street culture.

                    Mega-corporations in a dystopian future.
                    In cyberpunk settings, governments are weak or irrelevant, with massive corporations like
                    Arasaka in Cyberpunk 2077 controlling nearly every aspect of life, from law enforcement to 
                    technology development. These companies often abuse their power, manipulating individuals and 
                    societies to serve their interests.

                    Cyberpunk worlds are full of characters with cybernetic enhancements, from simple limb replacements to 
                    full-body modifications. These augmentations often blur the line between humanity and machine, 
                    raising questions about identity, the soul, and what it means to be human.
                    In Cyberpunk 2077, players can customize their characters with cyberware like enhanced vision, 
                    robotic limbs, and hacking capabilities. The cost of these upgrades is often physical and psychological, 
                    echoing broader transhumanism debates.

                        In cyberpunk worlds, powerful corporations dominate society, overshadowing weak governments 
                        and controlling technology, resources, and people's lives. This leads to a surveillance-heavy 
                        society where privacy is scarce, and underground resistance movements often form to fight back 
                        against corporate control. The struggle between those in power and those resisting raises questions 
                        about autonomy and the ethical use of technology.

                        Cyberpunk settings are typically dystopian, with massive, decaying cities marked by pollution, 
                        poverty, and rampant crime. While the wealthy live in luxury, the poor face harsh conditions. 
                        The natural world is often destroyed by industrial growth, and many people turn to virtual realities 
                        or underground movements as an escape from their grim reality, reflecting the societal and environmental 
                            consequences of unchecked technological development.

                    Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is an anime set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. It follows David Martinez, 
                    a teenager who enters the world of mercenaries, "edgerunners," and navigates Night City's brutal reality. 
                    The show explores social inequality, gang warfare, and the dangerous allure of technology in achieving power

                    the boundaries between sentient beings and machines are frequently tested. 
                    In Cyberpunk 2077, AI-driven characters like Johnny Silverhand question the ethical 
                    implications of uploading human consciousness into machines, exploring themes like immortality and 
                    free will.

                    In cyberpunk, hackers ("netrunners") are modern rebels, fighting oppressive regimes 
                    and corporations through digital means. In Cyberpunk 2077, hacking is not just about 
                    stealing data but also controlling and manipulating physical systems like security cameras, 
                    drones, or even human implants. The digital warfare of the future is fought in cyberspace.

                    Phantom Liberty is the expansion for Cyberpunk 2077 that introduces political espionage,

                    The DLC adds complexity to the dystopian narrative, where players must navigate 
                    alliances and deception to survive.

                    At the heart of cyberpunk lies a world of haves and have-nots. The wealthy live in luxury, 
                    protected by corporate forces, while the poor struggle for survival in slums filled with gangs, 
                    crime, and desperation. Characters like V in Cyberpunk 2077 or David in Cyberpunk Edgerunners highlight 
                    the tension between classes, where tech and power are held by the elite.

                    Cyberpunk draws heavily from the noir genre, featuring anti-heroes who are morally ambiguous, 
                    often trapped in a world of corruption, crime, and personal vengeance. Characters like V or Johnny 
                    Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077 represent individuals who fight the system, though not always for noble reasons.

                    Cyberspace is a digital realm in cyberpunk fiction, where hackers and netrunners operate. 
                    It's a place of both opportunity and danger, allowing for espionage, data theft, 
                    and even virtual assassination. In Cyberpunk 2077, cyberspace is explored through netrunning missions, 
                    where characters hack into systems and manipulate data, with high stakes and often deadly consequences.
